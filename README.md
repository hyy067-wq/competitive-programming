# Personal CP Stuff
Random collection of solved problems and other related stuff.

## Set up
I like to use a small set of tools that are widely accessible on all platforms 
(Unix, Linux, etc.). Nothing fancy, I am not a fan of too many bells and whistles.
I just like things to work, fast.

- Editor: nvim + tmux
- Debugger: gdb
- Other: Makefile for quick compile and executable clean up
