Collection of implementations and/or editorials I have written for problems 
across various competitive programming sites.

Solving these coding challenges is what initially drew me into the world of programming 
and sparked my continued interest in mathematics, computer science, and problem solving 
in general. A big part of my current ongoing desire to learn new things and seek creative 
outlets in challenging problems likely stems from this niche hobby I discovered 
in college. 

As such, I am glad I finally have sufficient spare time to engage in 
this activity more intensely and consistently.
